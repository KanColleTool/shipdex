Project Shipdex
===============

The Shipdex is like... a Pok√©dex, but for boatgirls. Yeah.

In other words, it's a bot that pulls updates from KanColle's servers at scheduled intervals, and uses [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) to build a static webpage from it, which is then automatically pushed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
